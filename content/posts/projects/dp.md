Doupai is a video editing tool that helps users create engaging videos and quickly share them on social media. Launched in 2014, ranked top 1 in the Chinese Apple Store multiple times, permanently stopped service for users in 2023.
  
I was primarily responsible for iOS video editing UI development. Most of the time, I independently built iOS UI modules and collaborated with another team to integrate the video rendering engine.

From February 2021 to May 2021, during a major version update, I had the opportunity to lead a team of 3 iOS engineers. I oversaw the development process, coordinated with the engine team, and mentored team members to understand and work with the complex video editing system.
